# CRISPR-VAE

The complete implementation for the paper:

* CRISPR-VAE: A Method for Explaining CRISPR/Cas12a Predictions, and an Efficiency-aware gRNA Sequence Generator

## Usage
1. The main file is CRISPR-VAE.ipynb, and can be operated on Google Colab.  

3. Get all files in NeededFiles, and the sub-directory Datasets,

5. the implementation assumes they are placed in your Google Drive at /Content/drive/My Drive/Colab/CRISPR-VAE.

7. For any change for the above directory or to operate the file locally, change all instances from the code
